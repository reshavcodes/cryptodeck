# CryptoDeck:heart:

This is a crypto web app where you can get the realtime price of the crypto coins and the price of the crypto coins in the past.

Filter to the price and news of particular crypto in the.

I have also added a option to show the graph of the price flutuation of the crypto coins.

It uses custom hooks to fetch the data from the API and to display the data.

## You can view the demo at:

### [CryptoDeck](https://cryptodeck.vercel.app/).

Star:star2:  the repository if you like it.

## Available Scripts (For Development use only :neutral_face::neutral_face:):

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
